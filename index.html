            humans! This is
            somewhere that I have taken my thoughts and fears on Ai and
            organized them. I have divided my thoughts into different pages that
            have different themes. Below is a quick description of a each page
            and that the purpose is meant to be.</p></div>

          <p>Can Ai create art? Is it the Ai's art or the humans that put in the
            prompt, or is it the developer of the tools art? These are things
            that I have gone into depth about on the Ai Art page. There will
            also be some images that have been fully generated with Ai tools
            along with the prompt that was put in and a link the tool used. </p>

          <p>One of the things that will arise from this Ai Revolution is the
            amount of jobs that it could cause to disappear over night. This
            page talks about the issues that we will face in the very near
            future dealing with Ai putting thousands of people out of work.
            There is a section that talks about jobs that are currently being
            lost do to Ai. I also propose my opinions on the best steps that we
            can take to prevent disaster</p>

          <p>With all the new chat bots that can answer questions on a chemistry
            quiz or with plugins can solve calculus equations for you why would
            you not use it? What about the people that have used these chat bots
            to debug code for their job? Is it wrong to use these Ai as tools in
            making your job/school easier? I go into the ethical and security
            issues that online Ai models can cause for people. I will give my
            opinions on the use of chat bots and other Ai tools to get your work
            done. </p>
