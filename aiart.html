          Can Ai create art? Is it the Ai's art or the humans that put in the
          prompt, or is it the developer of the tools art? These are things that
          I have gone into depth about on the Ai Art page. There will also be
          some images that have been fully generated with Ai tools along with
          the prompt that was put in and a link the tool used.

          In my opinion Ai does create art and things created with Ai are art.
          Art is subjective. Just because the paint bush was a prompt does not
          mean the art is invalid. Art evolves over time like anything, this is
          just a new era of art. People said that digital art was not art for a
          while because it was not created by the artist but created by the
          computer. This is a video of pictures that I took miles apart but with the power of Ai they can be combined into one picture within 2 minutes. The video is at 1000  speed.

          Is this picture art? This is a 90% Ai generated picture. I used
          Adobe's tools to create this from a picture that I took. Is this
          picture still art? Yes this is still art, granted it is a piece
          created with the help of Ai but still has my original photo as a
          starting point and my vision is what guided the Ai generated areas.

          This is the original photo that was used to generate the landscape.
          With a few single word prompts from me the Ai generated a life like
          rendering of what the area around the ache could look like. The Ai was
          wrong but made the picture look "correct".

          With fully generated content there is a lot more debate. In order for
          these Ai to create images from words they have to be trained and in
          the training lies the problem. Should the artists that created the
          data for the training be compensated? Or is this just like any other
          human that can learn how to paint by watching Bob Ross? In my opinion
          the use of Ai to generate images is a tool that will help many people
          break into fields that they would have never been able to. But my main
          issue is that the data sets are still a black box. We do not know how
          many artists work that do not want to be included are in the training
          of these models.

          If you are going to use Ai generated content then you should read the
          Terms of Service of any tool you use. This could come to bite you if
          you don't own your creations.
